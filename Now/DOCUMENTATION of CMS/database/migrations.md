# Database Migration Workflow & Safe Schema Protocol

## Overview

Database schema evolution in KUCET CMS is governed by Drizzle Kit (`drizzle-kit`) and a custom migration runner (`src/db/migrate.js`). The system enforces strict version control for all database DDL changes to prevent data loss or schema drift across development, staging, and production environments.

---

## The Golden Rule: NEVER Use `db:push` in Production

> [!CAUTION]
> `npm run db:push` (`drizzle-kit push`) bypasses migration files and directly mutates the target database schema. In production environments, `db:push` can cause catastrophic data loss, dropped tables, or inconsistent state. `db:push` is restricted exclusively to ephemeral local development prototypes. Production migrations MUST follow the strict generate-review-migrate protocol detailed below.

---

## Safe Schema Update Protocol

Every database schema change must adhere to the 4-step deployment pipeline:

flowchart LR
    Step1[1. Edit Schema Code\nsrc/db/schema/*.js] --> Step2[2. Generate Migration SQL\nnpm run db:generate]
    Step2 --> Step3[3. Manual SQL Review\nInspect drizzle/*.sql]
    Step3 --> Step4[4. Execute Migration\nnpm run db:migrate]
```

### Step 1: Modify Schema Definition
Edit the relevant modular domain file in `src/db/schema/` (e.g. adding a new column to `src/db/schema/identity.js`).

### Step 2: Generate Migration SQL
Execute Drizzle Kit generator:
```bash
npm run db:generate
```
This compares `src/db/schema.js` against existing migrations in `./drizzle/` and produces a new numbered SQL snapshot file (e.g., `./drizzle/0007_add_faculty_office.sql`).

### Step 3: Manual SQL Inspection
Open the generated `.sql` file in `./drizzle/` and review the DDL statements. Verify:
- Column data types and NULL constraints match requirements.
- Foreign key definitions enforce `ON DELETE RESTRICT` or `ON DELETE CASCADE` appropriately.
- Indexes have explicit names prefixed with `idx_` or `uq_`.

### Step 4: Execute Migration Runner
Run the migration execution script:
```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

## Fail-Safe Migration Execution Engine (`src/db/migrate.js`)

The project uses a custom migration execution runner that guarantees deployment stability across heterogeneous hosting environments (Local MySQL, TiDB Cloud, Render, CI runners, and Hostinger/Ubuntu VPS).

    alt DB connection refused in CI environment
        Migrate Script-->>CLI / CI Pipeline: Warn & skip cleanly (Exit Code 0)
    else DB connection established
        Migrate Script->>MetaTable: CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS __drizzle_migrations
        Migrate Script->>MySQL Database: Probe existing columns (topics_covered, academic_departments, etc.)
        alt Historical schema detected but unbaselined in __drizzle_migrations
            Migrate Script->>MetaTable: Baseline historical entries (0000-0018)
        end
        Migrate Script->>MySQL Database: Run official Drizzle migrator
        MySQL Database-->>Migrate Script: Migration complete
        Migrate Script-->>CLI / CI Pipeline: ✅ Migrations verified and executed successfully!
    end
```

### Resilient Features of `migrate.js`
1. **TiDB Cloud & SSL Auto-Detection**: Automatically injects TLS v1.2 configuration when connecting to TiDB Cloud or when `DB_SSL=true`.
2. **Clean CI Bypass**: Prevents build failures in CI workflows where database secrets are deliberately withheld by catching `ECONNREFUSED` and exiting cleanly.
3. **Intelligent Baselining**: Probes database metadata to detect existing schema structures (e.g. `attendance_sessions.topic_covered`, `academic_departments`, `staff_registration_requests.address`, `admission_status_history`) and automatically baselines matching journal entries to prevent destructive or failing repeat executions.
4. **Official Drizzle Runner**: Executes migrations strictly in dependency order using Drizzle ORM's migration engine.

## Pre-Deployment Schema & Migration Audit (`npm run db:check`)

To prevent schema commits without corresponding migration scripts or unjournaled migrations, both CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) and production deployment (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) enforce `npm run db:check` (`src/db/audit-migrations.mjs`):
1. **Drizzle Kit Check**: Executes `npx drizzle-kit check` to verify syntax and snapshot integrity.
2. **Journal Verification**: Asserts that all entries in `drizzle/meta/_journal.json` exist as SQL files on disk in `drizzle/`, and flags any unjournaled `.sql` files.
3. **Schema vs Migration Coverage**: Scans `src/db/schema/*.js` for all declared `mysqlTable` definitions and validates that every table is present in Drizzle snapshots or created in `drizzle/*.sql`.
4. **Baseline Rules Validation**: Validates that multi-environment baseline rules in `src/db/baseline-rules.js` are properly configured.

---

## Automated Multi-Environment Baseline Tracking (`src/db/baseline-rules.js`)

Multi-environment synchronization (local dev, TiDB Cloud, Hostinger VPS) relies on the declarative baseline registry in `src/db/baseline-rules.js`. Before Drizzle executes migrations:
1. `src/db/migrate.js` queries `__drizzle_migrations` for already recorded timestamps.
2. For unapplied entries, it evaluates the `isSatisfied(connection)` predicate of registered baseline rules.
3. If an existing schema structure is detected (e.g. `academic_departments` table, `staff_account_id` in faculty assignments, or `elective_groups` table), the runner records the migration in `__drizzle_migrations` without re-running duplicate DDL, ensuring idempotent deployments across all environments.
