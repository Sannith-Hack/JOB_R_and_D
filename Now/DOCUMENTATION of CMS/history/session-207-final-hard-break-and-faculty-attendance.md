# Session 207: Final Hard-Break Cleanup & Faculty Attendance Validation

**Date:** August 22, 2026  
**System Version:** Session 207 (testvanilla)  
**Status:** Completed, Verified & Merged to `main` (Commits `74b183fe`, `20517bfa`)  
**Test Suite Verification:** 50 Test Files Passed (370/370 Unit Tests Passed), 0 ESLint Errors, 203/203 Next.js Routes Compiled  
**Architectural Invariant:** Zero Active Clerk References Across All Source Files (`src/`)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This session finalized the **hard-breaking migration** from legacy `clerk` concepts to the unified institutional **`staff`** domain across every layer of the KUCET College Management System. All remaining legacy role references, translation shims, and compatibility logic were permanently removed with zero backward compatibility.

In addition, the **Faculty Attendance & Lecture Topic** module was fully audited, hardened, and verified end-to-end:
1. Lecture topic tracking was made strictly required ($\ge 2$ characters, whitespace-trimmed, max 500 characters).
2. The Lecture Topic Modal UI was synchronized across desktop and mobile sheets.
3. Server-side faculty assignment verification, duplicate attendance protection, and session ownership guards were validated.
4. Admission draft data was wired for zero-click automatic loading and realtime updates.
5. Storage asset delivery fallback for Render/VPS environments and Content Security Policy (CSP) worker directives were resolved.

## 2. Comprehensive Inventory of Changes

### 2.1 Elimination of Legacy Roles & Compatibility Logic
- **Public Staff Registration API** (`src/app/api/public/staff-registration/route.js`):
  - Removed legacy `'ADMISSION_CLERK'` and `'SCHOLARSHIP_CLERK'` from the Zod validation enum.
  - Enforced strict canonical enum: `['FACULTY', 'ADMISSION_STAFF', 'SCHOLARSHIP_STAFF']`.
  - Rejects any legacy submission with `400 Bad Request`.
  - Emits real-time event: `STAFF_REGISTRATION_CREATED`.
- **Admin Approval Route** (`src/app/api/admin/staff-requests/[id]/approve/route.js`):
  - Removed string substitution fallback logic (`roleToAssign.replace('_STAFF', '_CLERK')` / `_CLERK` → `_STAFF`).
  - Matches requested role directly against `staffRoles` lookup table and creates canonical assignments.
  - Emits real-time events: `STAFF_REGISTRATION_APPROVED` and `STAFF_CREATED`.
- **Authentication & Role Mapping**:
  - `src/app/api/auth/employee-login/route.js`, `src/app/api/auth/refresh/route.js`, `src/app/api/staff/me/route.js`, `src/lib/auth-utils.js`, and `src/app/api/admin/staff/route.js` now strictly resolve canonical role codes (`ADMISSION_STAFF` → `'admission'`, `SCHOLARSHIP_STAFF` → `'scholarship'`, `FACULTY` → `'faculty'`).
- **Eliminated Dead Files & Legacy Aliases**:
  - Deleted obsolete `src/components/Sidebar_legacy.js`.
  - Verified non-existence of `ClerkRegistrationService.js`; `StaffRegistrationService.js` is the sole canonical service.
  - Updated all security tabs, password management hooks, and UI navigation links.

### 2.2 Faculty Attendance & Lecture Topic Workflow
- **Topic Popup UI & Synchronization**:
  - [`LectureTopicModal.js`](file:///D:/User/Desktop/CMS/src/components/staff/faculty/LectureTopicModal.js) now enforces required topic entry with client-side validation (`topic.trim().length >= 2`).
  - Mounted `<LectureTopicModal>` in [`MobileAttendanceSheet.js`](file:///D:/User/Desktop/CMS/src/components/staff/faculty/MobileAttendanceSheet.js) ensuring both mobile and desktop views trigger the topic modal immediately after saving attendance.
- **Topic API Hardening** (`src/app/api/staff/faculty/attendance/session/topic/route.js`):
  - Enforces `topic_covered: z.string().trim().min(2, 'Topic covered is required (minimum 2 characters)').max(500)` in Zod schema.
  - Validates authenticated identity via `getAuthUser('faculty')`.
  - Checks faculty subject assignment, active substitution, or departmental HOD ownership.
  - Updates only `attendance_sessions.topic_covered` without mutating student attendance rows.
- **Attendance Endpoint Authorization**:
  - All endpoints (`attendance/route.js`, `session/route.js`, `status/route.js`, `history/route.js`, `full-history/route.js`, `bulk-sync/route.js`) strictly authenticate faculty identity, verify assignment ownership, prevent duplicate sessions, and respect semester lock rules (`isSemesterActive`).

### 2.3 Admission Draft Data & Realtime Updates
- **Zero-Click Mount Loading**:
  - Added `useEffect` hooks in `src/app/staff/admission/requests/page.js` and `src/components/staff/requests/AdmissionRequestsPanel.js` calling `refreshAdmissionDrafts()`. The drafts list populates instantly without requiring a manual "Sync" click.
- **Realtime SSE Broadcasts**:
  - Emitted `ADMISSION_DRAFT_CREATED` upon submission in `src/app/api/public/admission/route.js`.
  - Emitted `ADMISSION_DRAFT_UPDATED` & `ADMISSION_DRAFT_DELETED` in `src/app/api/staff/admission/drafts/[id]/route.js`.
  - Emitted `ADMISSION_DRAFT_FINALIZED` in `src/app/api/staff/admission/drafts/[id]/finalize/route.js`.
  - Configured `StaffContext.js` to auto-fetch admission drafts upon receiving realtime draft events.

### 2.4 Storage Fallback & Content Security Policy
- **Asset Fallback (`/api/assets/view/[...path]/route.js`)**:
  - If local disk stat fails (`!existingStat` on cloud platforms like Render), the route authenticates JWT and permissions, then performs a secure `HTTP 307` redirect to Cloudinary CDN (`kucet/${cleanKey}`).
- **Content Security Policy (`next.config.mjs`)**:
  - Added `child-src 'self' blob:;` alongside `worker-src 'self' blob:;` to eliminate CSP worker instantiation warnings across all browser engines.

## 3. Test Suite Verification

```text
✓ Total Test Files: 50 passed (50 total)
✓ Total Unit Tests: 370 passed (370 total)
✓ ESLint Result:    0 errors, 1 pre-existing warning
✓ Build Status:     Next.js 16 (Turbopack) 203/203 routes successfully generated
✓ Active Clerk Count: 0 in src/
```

### Key Test Suites:
- `tests/unit/api/staff/faculty-attendance-topic.test.js`: Verified topic update, required string validation, rejection of empty/whitespace input, unauthenticated 401, cross-faculty 403, and legacy clerk 401.
- `tests/unit/api/staff-authorization.test.js`: Verified role boundaries and rejection of `clerk_auth` cookies, `x-clerk-auth` headers, and legacy role payloads.
- `tests/unit/services/StaffRegistrationService.test.js`: Verified acceptance of canonical roles and rejection of legacy `ADMISSION_CLERK`, `SCHOLARSHIP_CLERK`, and `CLERK`.
- `tests/unit/services/AttendanceService.test.js`: Verified topic normalization, 500-char truncation, and rejection of whitespace-only input.

## 4. Architectural Rules Summary

1. **Zero Clerk Compatibility**: No active code, cookies, headers, schemas, or role enums may use `clerk`.
2. **Canonical Staff Roles**: `FACULTY`, `ADMISSION_STAFF`, `SCHOLARSHIP_STAFF`.
3. **Session Topics**: Every completed attendance session must capture a required topic ($\ge 2$ characters).
4. **Isolated Workspaces**: Faculty members may only modify their assigned subject sessions or valid substitutions.
