## 🐳 Multi-Container Docker Compose Stack (`docker-compose.yml`)

Production services are orchestrated using Docker Compose inside an isolated bridge network (`cms-network`).

## ⚡ Nginx Upstream Optimization (`nginx.conf`)

The **Nginx** container acts as the primary ingress edge, terminating SSL, handling WebSocket upgrades, compressing assets, and protecting authentication routes against brute-force rate attacks.

### Nginx Configuration Highlights

```nginx
events {
    worker_connections 2048;
}

http {
    include       mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;

    limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=auth_limit:10m rate=5r/s;
    limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=api_limit:10m rate=30r/s;

    # Gzip & Brotli Compression
    gzip on;
    gzip_comp_level 6;
    gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript text/xml application/xml;

    upstream nextjs_upstream {
        server app:3000 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=10s;
        keepalive 32;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name cms.kucet.ac.in;
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }

    server {
        listen 443 ssl http2;
        server_name cms.kucet.ac.in;

            expires 30d;
            add_header Cache-Control "public, no-transform";
        }

        # Auth Route Rate Limiting
        location /api/auth/ {

        }

        # Realtime WebSocket Proxying (Supabase & SSE)
        location /api/realtime/ {

## 🤖 Automated CI/CD Pipeline & Deployment Workflow

Deployment is fully automated using GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).

### Workflow Quality Gates
1. **ESLint & Code Formatting Check**: Executes `npm run lint` to enforce standard syntax rules.
2. **Unit & Integration Test Suite**: Executes `npm test` via Vitest.
3. **End-to-End (E2E) Test Suite**: Executes Playwright test suites (`npx playwright test`).
4. **Docker Image Build**: Compiles Next.js standalone build in Docker context and tags image.
5. **VPS Deployment via Self-Hosted Runner**:
   - Executes automated database snapshot (`DEPLOYMENT_PACKAGE/SCRIPTS/nightly-backup.sh`).
   - Runs Drizzle DB migrations (`npm run db:migrate`).
   - Rebuilds and restarts the Next.js app and Socket.IO realtime containers.
   - Validates Nginx reverse proxy configuration (`nginx -t`) and executes safe reload.
   - Runs the comprehensive 23-point system health check (`DEPLOYMENT_PACKAGE/SCRIPTS/health-check.sh`).
   - Automatically triggers atomic rollback if any critical service check fails.

### CI/CD Invariants & Operational Standards
- **Git Working Tree Invariant**: In deployment pipelines, Git checkout must NEVER fail due to local working tree drifts. Deployment scripts use atomic remote reset:
  ```bash
  git fetch origin "$BRANCH" 2>&1
  git reset --hard "origin/$BRANCH" 2>&1
  git clean -fd 2>&1
  ```
- **Canonical File Mode Tracking**: All shell scripts in `DEPLOYMENT_PACKAGE/SCRIPTS/` are tracked with executable bit `100755` in the Git index (`git update-index --chmod=+x`), preventing runtime `chmod +x` commands from marking files as dirty on Linux.
- **Server User & Group Ownership**: `/var/www/kucet-cms` is owned by `deployer:users` (UID `1001:100`) with permissions `u+rwX,g+rwX`. This allows both the GitHub Actions runner daemon (`deployer`) and SSH maintenance users (`kucet-dev`) to execute builds, update files, and write logs without permission errors.
- **Persistent Storage Volumes**: Host directory `/var/www/kucet-storage` is owned by UID `1001:1001` with `755` permissions, mounted inside containers at `/app/storage` to preserve user uploads independently of code checkouts.

## 🌐 Dual Ingress Architecture: Private Tailnet Mesh vs Public Funnel Edge Relays

The self-hosted deployment supports two distinct traffic ingress paths:

1. **Private Tailnet Route (Admin / Development Laptop):**
   - **Mechanism:** The laptop runs the Tailscale client and is joined to the tailnet (`official.kucet@`, IP `100.78.176.78`).
   - **Resolution:** Tailscale MagicDNS intercepts `kucet-dev-hp-pro-tower-280-g9-pci-desktop-pc.tailf6b4a7.ts.net` and resolves it directly to the internal overlay IP **`100.102.153.50`**.
   - **Path:** Traffic flows strictly through the encrypted WireGuard peer mesh or direct DERP tunnel, completely bypassing public internet DNS, external firewalls, and carrier routing.

2. **Public Internet Ingress Route (Students, Faculty Mobile Devices, General Public):**
   - **Mechanism:** External mobile devices (4G/5G/Broadband) have no Tailscale client installed.
   - **Resolution:** Public DNS (Google `8.8.8.8`, Cloudflare `1.1.1.1`, or telecom carrier DNS) resolves `*.tailf6b4a7.ts.net` to Tailscale's public Funnel edge proxy IPs (`103.84.155.217`, `103.84.155.153`, and IPv6 `2403:...`).
   - **Path:** Requests connect to Tailscale's public Funnel edge relays. Tailscale terminates external TLS with Let's Encrypt certificates, tunnels the requests over the DERP control channel to the host machine's `tailscaled` daemon, which forwards decrypted HTTP traffic to `http://127.0.0.1:80` (Nginx) -> Next.js container (`http://127.0.0.1:3000`).

## 🛡️ Disaster Recovery & Backup Strategy

- **Database Snapshots**: Automated daily database export script (`src/db/backup.js`) dumps schema and data, uploading compressed `.sql.gz` archives to S3 storage and local backup volumes.
- **Persistent Volume Mounts**: VPS directory `/var/www/kucet-storage` is mounted persistently across container restarts to preserve uploaded documents.
