**Date:** September 3, 2026  
**Incident Status:** Resolved & Verified  
**Target Server:** `kucet-dev-hp-pro-tower-280-g9-pci-desktop-pc` (Ubuntu Linux 24.04 LTS / Hostinger KVM / Desktop Tower Node)  
**Public Endpoint:** `https://kucet-dev-hp-pro-tower-280-g9-pci-desktop-pc.tailf6b4a7.ts.net`  
**Overall System Health:** 23/23 Diagnostic Checks Passed (0 Failures)

## 1. Executive Summary & Root Cause Analysis

### 1.1 The Incident
Visitors to the production KUCET College Management System experienced intermittent "Service Temporarily Unavailable" and perpetual "Offline" fallback states, preventing student and faculty portal access.

### 1.2 Multi-Layer Root Causes Identified

1. **Carrier-Grade University NAT Boundary:**
   - The physical server is located within the Kakatiya University campus network (`172.100.122.210/16`) egressing via `14.139.85.68`.
   - The institutional border firewall does not forward incoming TCP 80/443 traffic from the public IP.
   - Consequently, public ingress relies on NAT-traversal edge tunneling (Tailscale Funnel / Cloudflare Tunnel).

2. **DERP Relay Dropout & PWA Navigation Interception:**
   - Tailscale Funnel connections transit DERP relay nodes (Bengaluru). Brief network jitter or handshake resets (`TLS handshake error: EOF`) caused momentary browser fetch failures.
   - The Service Worker (`public/sw.js`) intercepted the failed navigation fetch and served the cached `/offline` page.

3. **Infinite Offline Reload Loop Trap (`src/app/offline/OfflineClient.js`):**
   - When the connection restored and `/api/health` responded with `200 OK`, `OfflineClient.js` invoked `window.location.reload()`.
   - Because the browser was sitting at `/offline`, `reload()` simply refreshed `/offline` over and over, permanently trapping the user on the offline screen even after server connectivity was healthy.
   - Additionally, on initial load before the health check responded, `checkResult` defaulted to `null`, causing the UI to display "Service Temporarily Unavailable" prematurely.

4. **Missing Production Cron Self-Healing Daemons:**
   - The host system lacked scheduled cron execution of `monitor.sh` and `boot-recovery.sh`. As a result, transient Docker or network issues were not automatically remediated.

## 3. Engineering Fixes & Hardening Applied

### 3.1 Client-Side Offline Page & Navigation Loop Elimination (`OfflineClient.js`)
- Replaced `window.location.reload()` with `window.location.replace('/')` (or previous referrer) to navigate users back to the live portal upon reconnection.
- Added `sessionStorage` throttle guard (`OFFLINE_RELOAD_KEY`) to eliminate rapid reload cycles.
- Added explicit "Verifying Connection..." state during health check pings, preventing premature error messaging.
- Added an interactive "Return to Portal" action button.

### 3.2 Enhanced 23-Point System Health Diagnostics (`health-check.sh`)
Refactored `DEPLOYMENT_PACKAGE/SCRIPTS/health-check.sh` to classify and test all 11 critical failure domains:
1. Docker Container Status (`app`, `realtime`, `proxy`, `db`, `redis`, `monitor`)
2. Database Connectivity (`mysqladmin ping -h localhost`)
3. Redis Connectivity (`redis-cli ping` -> `PONG`)
4. Local HTTP Health (`/api/health` -> `200 OK`)
5. Realtime WebSocket Health (`http://127.0.0.1:4000/health` -> `200 OK`)
6. Admin Endpoint Protection (`/api/admin/staff-requests`, `/api/admin/hod-requests`)
7. PWA Assets (`/sw.js`, `/offline`)
8. Host Power Management (Verification of masked sleep/suspend targets)
9. Tailscale Daemon & Funnel Ingress Reachability
10. Nginx Syntax & Upstream Configuration (`nginx -t`)
11. Host & Container Persistent Storage Permissions (`/var/www/kucet-storage`)
12. Resource Headroom (Disk space & RAM thresholds)

### 3.3 Production Cron Automation & Boot Recovery
Installed persistent system crontab entries for `deployer`/`kucet-dev`:
- `*/5 * * * *`: `monitor.sh` (Health probing, container auto-recovery, rollback on 3 consecutive failures)
- `@reboot`: `boot-recovery.sh` (Docker daemon wait, sleep target masking, container initialization)
- `30 2 * * *`: `nightly-backup.sh` (MySQL dump + 14-day retention pruning)
- `0 4 * * *`: `offsite-backup.sh` (Offsite backup sync)
