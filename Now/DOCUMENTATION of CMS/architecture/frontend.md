## ⚡ Next.js 16 App Router Architecture

The frontend application uses **Next.js 16** with the App Router paradigm under `src/app/`. The router enforces strict directory-based role partitioning to ensure clear separation of UI concerns.

### Portal Layout Hierarchy

```

### Server vs. Client Component Strategy
To optimize initial page load speeds and search indexability, KUCET CMS enforces a strict component classification:

1. **React Server Components (RSC)** (Default): Used for all page layout containers (`page.js`, `layout.js`), initial data fetching, complex security checks, and static SEO content. RSC eliminates client-side JavaScript overhead for static markup.
2. **Client Components (`'use client'`)**: Isolated to interactive UI elements such as modal drawers, dynamic search tables, GPS geolocation triggers, form submitters, and `useOptimistic` hook consumers.

---

## 🚀 React 19 Engine Capabilities

KUCET CMS leverages **React 19** primitives to deliver instant user responsiveness and eliminate UI blocking:

### Key React 19 Features Used
- **Server Actions**: Native async functions called directly from Client Form handlers, removing manual `fetch('/api/...')` boilerplate.
- **`useOptimistic`**: Renders immediate state feedback for user operations prior to network completion.
- **`useTransition`**: Keeps current screens interactive while loading sub-routes or executing heavy filtering operations in the background.
- **`useActionState`**: Manages form submit states, validation error messages, and loading spinners cleanly without custom hooks.

## 💅 Tailwind CSS 4 Design System

The application styling is built on **Tailwind CSS 4** using `@tailwindcss/postcss` for high performance and low bundle output size.

### Institutional Theme Palette
The design system reflects Kakatiya University's official brand aesthetics:

| Theme Token | Color Hex / Value | Usage Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Institutional Blue** | `#1e3a8a` (`blue-900`) | Primary headers, navigation bars, official badges |
| **Kakatiya Gold** | `#d97706` (`amber-600`) | Accents, active indicators, pending status pills |
| **Emerald Green** | `#059669` (`emerald-600`)| Approved status, successful attendance mark |
| **Rose Red** | `#e11d48` (`rose-600`) | Rejections, security warnings, detention flags |
| **Glass Background** | `rgba(255,255,255,0.8)` | Dynamic frosted glass card overlays |

## ⚡ Optimistic UI Updates (`useOptimistic`)

To eliminate latency on mobile networks, KUCET CMS uses React 19's `useOptimistic` hook for operations like marking attendance, approving student modification requests, or updating application statuses.

### Architectural Implementation Pattern

```javascript
'use client';

import { useOptimistic, useTransition } from 'react';
import { updateStudentStatusAction } from '@/app/actions/student';

export function StudentStatusManager({ student }) {
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

  // 1. Declare optimistic state hook
  const [optimisticStatus, setOptimisticStatus] = useOptimistic(
    student.status,
    (currentStatus, newStatus) => newStatus
  );

  const handleStatusChange = async (newStatus) => {
    startTransition(async () => {
      // 2. Immediately update UI state optimistically
      setOptimisticStatus(newStatus);

      // 3. Perform network call via Server Action or API
      const result = await updateStudentStatusAction(student.id, newStatus);
      if (!result.success) {
        // React automatically rolls back optimistic status on state update failure
        alert('Status update failed: ' + result.error);
      }
    });
  };

  return (
    <div className="flex items-center space-x-2">
      <span className={`badge ${optimisticStatus === 'APPROVED' ? 'bg-emerald-600' : 'bg-amber-600'}`}>
        {optimisticStatus} {isPending && '...'}
      </span>
      <button 
        disabled={isPending}
        onClick={() => handleStatusChange('APPROVED')}
        className="px-3 py-1 bg-blue-900 text-white rounded-md text-sm"
      >
        Approve Student
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 🔄 Role-Based Context Hydration & Dashboard State Flow (`StaffContext.js`, `AdminContext.js`)

To prevent dashboard variable starvation and stale cross-role data leaks across accounts, the state management layer enforces strict context hydration and lifecycle purging:

### 1. Account-Switch State Invalidation
`StaffContext` tracks `staff?.id` and `staff?.role` with a dedicated `useRef(staff?.id)`. Whenever the authenticated account changes (e.g. login/logout or account switch):
- All sub-resources (`facultyAssignments`, `facultyInterests`, `pendingProfileRequests`, `pendingCertificateRequests`, `admissionDrafts`, `studentHistory`, `hodBranchData`) are immediately purged to initial states.
- Lazy fetching tracking flags (`hasFetchedAssignments`, etc.) are reset.

### 2. Proactive Role-Scoped Hydration
During `refreshAllData()`, `StaffContext` evaluates the active `staff.role` and eagerly issues background queries for that role's primary data models:
- **`faculty`**: Eagerly loads faculty subject allocations (`/api/staff/faculty/assignments`) and teaching interests (`/api/staff/faculty/interests`).
- **`admission` / `admission_clerk`**: Eagerly queries student change requests (`/api/staff/admission/requests`), admission drafts (`/api/staff/admission/drafts`), and admission registration history.
- **`scholarship` / `scholarship_clerk`**: Eagerly loads pending certificate applications (`/api/staff/certificates/pending?category=scholarship`).
- **`hod`** (or active HOD designation): Eagerly fetches departmental branch metrics, faculty rosters, and timetables (`/api/staff/hod/branch-data`).

### 3. Loop-Free Client Dashboard Mounting
Client dashboard consumers (`FacultyDashboardClient`, `ScholarshipDashboardClient`, `AdmissionDashboardClient`, `HODConsole`, `CertificateDashboard`) implement ref-guarded and context-backed triggers on mount (`hasFetchedRef`), eliminating duplicate network requests while guaranteeing immediate variable resolution even if direct page routing bypasses the top-level layout refresh.

## 📱 Universal Mobile Navigation & Drawer Architecture

Given that over 80% of student and faculty interactions occur on smartphones, KUCET CMS provides a dedicated mobile navigation layout:

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| [≡] KUCET CMS             [Notification Bell]  [Profile]    |  <-- Mobile Top Header
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                             |
|                   MAIN PORTAL CONTENT                       |
|                                                             |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| [🏠 Home]  [📅 Attendance]  [💰 Fees]  [📄 Certificates] |  <-- Fixed Bottom Navigation Bar
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Drawer & Navigation Features
- **Dynamic Slide-Over Drawer**: Uses Tailwind CSS transforms and touch-swipe gestures to reveal role-specific navigation links without screen reloads.
- **Focus Trapping & Accessibility**: Prevents background scrolling when drawers are open (`overflow-hidden` on `body`) and handles `Escape` key close events.
- **Mobile Topbar Profile Badge (`MobileTopbar.js`)**: Displays authenticated user avatar with path-scoped role context isolation. Clicking the avatar routes directly to the active role's profile view (`/student/profile` or `/staff/[role]/profile`), smoothly auto-hiding when already on profile views.
- **Active Session Bar**: Persistent mobile status bar alerting students of active attendance sessions nearby.

## 🎯 Student Dashboard Priority Actions Engine (`DashboardActionCenter.js`)

The student dashboard features a high-priority, real-time Action Center that dynamically surfaces mission-critical institutional items:

1. **Active Attendance Verification**: Real-time 4-digit PIN verification inputs with 50m Haversine GPS geofence checks and device fingerprint lock (`kucet_device_uuid`).
2. **Current Period & Class Alert**: Displays real-time subject name, room number, faculty name, and period time ranges, synchronized instantly via `BroadcastChannel('kucet_sse_sync')`.
3. **Scholarship Action Pipeline**: Dynamic government scholarship alerts for hard-copy submission deadlines, Mee-Seva biometric thumb verification, and ePASS application windows with client-side dismissal state persistence.
4. **Certificate & Update Request Status**: Instant status tracking pills (Pending, Approved, Rejected) with direct links to request history.

---

## 🧩 Isolated Edit & Review Modals (`src/components/ui/edit-modals/`)

Administrative edit and review modals are modularized into standalone portal components under `src/components/ui/edit-modals/`:
- **`AdmissionModal.js`**: Draft applicant editing, verification, quota review, and non-destructive image loading fallbacks.
- **`CertificateReviewModal.js`**: Document validation, one-click authorization, and rejection dialog triggers.
- **`StudentUpdateReviewModal.js`**: Side-by-side diff comparison between current registry records and requested modifications with proof document previews.

---

## 📲 Progressive Web App (PWA) & Offline Support

KUCET CMS is built as an installable Progressive Web App meeting web PWA standards:

### 1. Web App Manifest (`public/manifest.json`)
Defines application branding, theme colors (`#1e3a8a`), offline display modes (`standalone`), and high-resolution institutional launcher icons (`192x192`, `512x512`).

### 2. Service Worker Architecture (`public/sw.js`)
- **Stale-While-Revalidate**: Serves cached UI shells instantly while fetching updated assets in the background.
- **Offline Asset Pre-caching**: Caches core CSS, JavaScript bundles, fonts, and static logos (`ku-logo.png`, `kakatiya-kala-thoranam.png`).

### 3. Offline Attendance Queuing (`src/lib/idb-attendance.js`)
When faculty or students lose connectivity inside campus areas with weak cellular coverage, attendance records are stored locally in browser **IndexedDB**. Once network connectivity is restored, the PWA background sync manager flushes queued records to `/api/staff/faculty/attendance`.

```javascript
// Example IndexedDB Offline Attendance Queueing Flow
import { openDB } from 'idb';

const DB_NAME = 'kucet_offline_store';

export async function queueOfflineAttendance(attendanceRecord) {
  const db = await openDB(DB_NAME, 1, {
    upgrade(db) {
      db.createObjectStore('attendance_queue', { keyPath: 'id', autoIncrement: true });
    },
  });
  await db.add('attendance_queue', {
    ...attendanceRecord,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
  });
  console.info('[PWA] Attendance record queued offline in IndexedDB');
}
```
